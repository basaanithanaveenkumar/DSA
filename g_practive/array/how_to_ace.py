"""
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. ask more questions about input (company based)
     a. what should I return if the input is empty
     b. what is the range of input (boundaries of input)
     c. does input constains 0
     d. does input contains negative values
     e. does input contains numbers or aphabets
     f. what is the maximum length of array 
3. Learn topic wise
4. Think form reverse
5. focus on how to solve the problem (optimize later)
6. always communicate
7. be calm
8. communicate fluently

9. *******draw everything in google doc
10. ********* pleases run the dry run
11. check the syntax double times , you are making mistake over here
12. *** always write the condition for out of bounds

# last minute recision
1. climbing stairs--> fib series
2. Jumpgame --> greedy, or come from last
3. Longest common sub sequence -- use @cache 
4. Longest palindromic substring -- try for odd and even palindromes seperately




# how to import queue
from collections import deque
q=deque()
q.append() ## addes an element
q.popleft() ## does the BFS
q.pop() #does the DFS

# how to import heap and use it
import heapq
heapq.heappop() # to pop

# whenever greating a graph use the 
graph=defaultdict(list)

# learn digistra algorithm



# reverse a number 
while x > reverted:
        reverted = reverted * 10 + x % 10
        x = x // 10
