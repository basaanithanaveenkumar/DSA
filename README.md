# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, organized by topic. Each folder contains implementations and problem solutions related to specific DSA concepts.

## Preparation strategy and material

### [Sliding window] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaXwHThEgGk&list=WL&index=1&ab_channel=GregHogg)
#### variable length
#### fixed length

### Tree
#### Depth first search
#### Breadth first search bothe iterative and recursive

### Linked list
#### Reverse a linked list

#### Two pointers

#### Prefix sum

#### Heapsort
